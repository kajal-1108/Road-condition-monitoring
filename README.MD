#### Abstract

Rapid advances in computer vision mean a wide range of potential applications. One of these is the increasing use of street-level images. This has many potential applications for local government, with public services utilising object detection and other computer vision techniques to identify street-level issues. This thesis will focus on using computer vision with street-level images to perform road condition monitoring. In particular, we will use deep learning including semantic segmentation to identify roads, localise and classify road condition issues. We will assess the effectiveness of transfer learning in deep convolutional neural networks trained on images from other domains (unrelated to roads) and other settings (road condition monitoring outside the Netherlands). This research will be undertaken as part of an internship with the Gemeente Amsterdam.
